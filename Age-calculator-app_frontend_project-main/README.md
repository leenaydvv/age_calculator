## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The date is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

I have ensured to provide an intuitive user experience with responsive design and error handling for accurate age calculation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- DOM manipulation
- Vanilla JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.


## Acknowledgments

I feel like the solutions provided on the website and the continuous doubt solving by industry experts on discord for free is something that is unmatched by anyone else and need to be acknowledged for their efforts in improving me as a developer by suggesting the best practices in your respective tech stack.

## Got feedback for me?

I love receiving feedback! I am always looking to improve my code and take up new innovative ideas to work upon. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email 'hi' at saarsaach30[at]gmail[dot]com.
